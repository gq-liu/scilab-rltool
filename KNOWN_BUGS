
The new graphics style isn't fully developed. All plots are rendered in a "jittery" manner. I hope things will get better with the next version of Scilab. 

sgrid() doesn't work too well. It overwrites the rootlocus branches and at 
times the values of zeta aren't seen. This might need modification of the 
native scilab code. 

gain margin routine of scilab seems to have a bug. Rltool crashes due to 
this (?) for certain transfer functions.

Scilab mouse handler can not recognize co-ordinates in subplots. Hence, I have not been able to implement mouse-aided controls in frequency domain. The values displayed along with the bode plot in Design-->Frequency mode are therefore incorrect.

If you find any other bug, kindly let me know by e-mail. I shall be 
thankful if you let me know the solution as well....
