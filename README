                RLTOOL for Scilab
                ===========================
A graphics based tool for designing SISO systems by Ishan Pendharkar.
Ported from Holger  Nahrstaedt to scilab 5.3

RLTOOL (version 1.7) 
======================

Information about current version of RLTOOL can be found at 
http://wwwa.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/people/ishan/scilab/rltool.htm

This url also shows older versions and the current (unstable) one.

Installation
============
We Suppose here that <PATH> stands for  the path of the directory
containing this README file.

- On Unix/Linux systems
     * Administrator
        Has to execute, ONCE, the following instruction 
        within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>/builder.sce 
       	This operation requires permission to write in <PATH>/macros to 
	generate *.bin, names and lib files. 
     * User
        Should execute the following instruction within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>/loader.sce 
        before using the toolbox, he  can also put it  in his
        .scilab startup file for automatic loading.

	Note that a user will have to execute <PATH>/loader.sce EVERY TIME 
	after starting a NEW Scilab session before using RLTOOL.

- On Windows systems
     * Administrator
        Has to execute, ONCE the following instruction 
        within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>\builder.sce 
        This operation requires permission to
        write in <PATH>\macros to generate *.bin, names and lib files 
     * User
        Should execute the following instruction within Scilab:
        exec <PATH>\loader.sce
        before using the toolbox, he  can also put it  in his
        .scilab startup file for automatic loading.

	Note that a user will have to execute <PATH>\loader.sce EVERY TIME 
	after starting a NEW Scilab session before using RLTOOL.


NOTES:
=====
	- FOR UNIX/LINUX users 
	++++++++++++++++++++++
	* "Administrator" need not be ROOT. Administrator denotes ANYONE 
	who has permission to write in <PATH>/macros. Suppose I (Ishan) have
	downloaded rltool-1.*.tar.gz into my home directory /home/ishan
	I do the following to start using RLTOOL
	
	step 1. "untar" the zipped file. The fact that you are reading this
	README shows you completed step 1 :) This has generated a directory 
	called rltool in my home directory. So my PATH is /home/ishan/rltool

	step 2. start scilab

	step 3. At the scilab prompt, type
	--> exec /home/ishan/rltool/builder.sce

	you need to do this only ONCE. This "compiles" the *.sci files 
	and generated binary files.

	step 4. To "load" rltool into Scilab, type the following at the
	Scilab prompt
	--> exec /home/ishan/rltool/loader.sce

	you will need to "load" rltool every time you start a FRESH scilab 
	session, or issue an explicit "clear" instruction at the Scilab prompt

	step 5. type rlt() to start using rltool 


	step 6 If you are indeed the root, you may want to "build" rltool once 
	so that multiple users can access it simultaneously. 


  	-For Windows users
	+++++++++++++++++
	Same as for Linux above, only replace "/" with "\". Your PATH typically would be C:\rltool.

	The complete HTML manual of rltool comes along with the package. You cannot
	currently access it from within Scilab. To view the manual, please direct
	your favourite web browser to the location
	PATH\man\whatis.htm. You can access this manual directly from Scilab on 
	a *nix installation. A PDF version of the manual is available at 
	PATH\man\whatis.pdf
