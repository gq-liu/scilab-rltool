Rltool 1.7
for Scilab 4.1.1
Minor improvements and bug fixes
a "Welcomemessage" menu added
Some bugs related to Scilab graphics have been removed, so additional 
features have been added, e.g. both Magnitude and Phase plot in "preview"

improved documentation

Rltool 1.6
for Scilab 3.1.1

Many important internal changes. Gui improved. 

Slider for gain change.

Closed loop poles are marked on the rootlocus.

A "Design mode" provided for fast control system design.

incorporated with the "new" graphics style of scilab. 
"save/load" menu incorporated into the "plant" menu.

All configuration parameters are accessible to the user in an Ascii file called Rltool-1.*_Config.sci. 

Plant can be saved/loaded in a ascii file, instead of a binary file as before. 
----------------------------------------------------------
Rltool beta 1.5
For Scilab 3.0

Bug removed: rltool didnot work with Windows version... changed xgetmouse() to xclick()

Documentation has been improved. Several inconsistencies and mistakes have
been corrected.

The "Edit" menu has been renamed as "Plant". Thus, to add a pole you would
click on Plant->add pole, instead of Edit->add pole.

Removed bug: rltool-1.4 crashed with scilab 3.0, removed a bug with the 
help of Scilab team.

html manual can now be called from within rltool. The desired browser can 
be set and it can be started on a *nix terminal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following changes have been made in version 1.4 of RLTOOL

the directory devel has been added for people who wish to tweak/develop 
rltool. 

A global choice of frequency units is available. 

Numerical values of closed loop parameters are available. 

At every value of the gain, you can "preview" closed loop poles and zeros, 
step response, closed loop bode plot and sensitivity plot. These are 
ofcourse, also available through Response-->closedloop.

You can select the gain configuration to be "K in forward path" or "K in 
feedback path". 

An option for "number of cycles" has been added in the sinusoidal 
response.

Popov plot has been added. 

Documentation has been greatly increased and (hopefully) improved.

--------------------------------------------------------
Following changes have been made in version 1.3 of RLTOOL 

Removed a bug of step response details. Can handle non-minimum phase step 
responses. zeta corresponding to second order approximation is displayed. 

Extensive changes and reorganization of responses. You can now view 
following closed loop responses
	Impulse
	Step
	Ramp
	Arbitrary piece wise linear, single valued input
	Sinusoidal (one period)
	Bode plot
	Sensitivity plot

in addition to
	Nyquist plot
	Nichols plot

Documentation has been slightly improved and organized. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Following changes have been made in version 1.2 of RLTOOL 

Added frequency plots (Nyquist, Bode, Nichols, sensitivity) with 
choice of units in Hz and Rad/sec. These codes have been provided by Jose 
Paulo Vilela Soares da Cunha, Brazil. 

Added step response details. 

Improved error handling. 

Added pole-zero plot of transfer function. 

Added UNDO option to EDIT. This enables u to undo changes to your plant. 

Online help added. 

Man pages are included in both *.cat and *.htm formats. The former are 
retained to enable help users with older Scilab versions. 

Added a cool logo for RLTOOL :-) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Following changes have been made in the version 1.1 of rltool 
Many bugs have been removed, but many more may remain. Please let me 
know bug reports. 
  

Added sgrid() to evans root locus 
Utility for checking \omega_n and \zeta. 

Added sensitivity plot to menu. 

2-D grid sizing problem solved. (bug removed) 
Grid didnot "fit in" the plot in old version. 

Fixed the bug "cancel". (bug removed) 
Cancel was not working in old version 

Added functions from plotlib. Installation of plotlib is no longer 
essential. 
rltool can now be used without installing Plotlib 

Fixed bug of zooming step response. (bug removed) 
Step response couldnot be zoomed 

Recursion problem removed. (bug removed) 
Stack was getting full in old version 

Save/load problem removed. (bug removed) 
Saving/loading was erratic in old version.
